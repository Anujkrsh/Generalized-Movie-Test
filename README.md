# Generalized-Movie-Test

-----------------------------------------------------------Movie Test---------------------------------------------------------

IMdb and Wikipedia are two great resources to take information about the movies which were released in past or are releasing in present or will release in future and they really helps the movie buffs to decide what to watch

Our this Program is also for movie buffs. This program extract two things -

--Country

--Release Date

From both websites i.e. Wikipedia and IMdb, compares the data and validates whether the data on both the websites matches or not.

Pre-requisites- TestNG plugin, Cucumber plugin, Selenium, Maven, IDE (Eclipse,Intellij,Spring Tool Suite,etc..)

I have also generalised the code so that it could not only work for just one movie but more than that.
